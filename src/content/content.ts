I'm starting up a personal blog again as I felt like I could benefit from a consistent, creative outlet.

#### What are you gonna write about tho?
I plan to write about some random stuff I find interesting relating (but not limited) to tech, transportation, and history.
I also plan on documenting my running progress - might even start cycling soon.
Really hoping that I can keep up something consistent this time.

Stay tuned!`,

## Summary
I ran the Toronto Waterfront Half Marathon last weekend on October 20th, 2024.

*Weather*: Perfect - 8 degrees @ start, 13 degrees @ finish

*Goal*: <2:00:00

*Time*: 1:57:12

*Pace*: ~5:33 min/km

## Thoughts

#### Training
My first half-marathon went pretty terribly a few months ago because of an IT band injury - finished in 2:50ish.

I gave myself the ambitious goal of sub 2 hours to keep myself disciplined with my training, which I feel worked.
During the training, I got my 5k time down from 31 minutes to 24 minutes and did long runs almost every week.

Training throughout the summer was disgusting, but admittedly, rewarding.

#### The race
The route was beautiful - got to see the best parts of downtown and enjoy the peaceful waterfront right after.

The crowds were amazing and it really felt like the entire city was there to either run or cheer us on. (22000 people ran on Sunday!)
I especially loved the crowds on Bathurst - they made me feel like I was flying down from Bloor to Lakeshore.

I felt *really* good up to 15k, felt like I was gonna die at 20k.

Everyone else I ran with this weekend also did amazing and beat their goals.
Really appreciate the friendly faces that came out to cheer us all on.

#### Future
I signed up for the Chilly Half Marathon coming up in March of 2025.
I'm wondering if I can get my time down to sub 1:50 for that race.


I also feel like a full marathon isn't completely off the table anymore... this race was too fun to not consider that again.
